<h2 class="explain">
  A Universal Epidemic 
</h2>

<p class="first">Mass shootings represent a traumatic manifestation of pure violence and fear that has plagued all corners of the United States. These horrific incidents involve the deliberate targeting of multiple individuals in public spaces, leaving a trail of devastation, loss, and shattering the lives of countless individuals. Whether schools, workplaces, or other public settings, mass shootings are prevalent in an array of settings. This in turn strikes fear into the hearts of a multitude communities and challenges the very fabric of societal security. These events cause extensive shockwaves that ripple far beyond the immediate casualties, permeating the collective consciousness and sparking urgent conversations about gun control, mental health, and societal factors that contribute to such acts of violence. Lt. Matthew Malinowski, head of media inquires within the Syracuse Police Department, provides valuable insight regarding the root of this continuous issue and plausible resolutions. </p>

<h2 class="reason"> Why the Problem Persists</h2>

<p class="second">
The absence of comprehensive background checks and mental health assessments when purchasing firearms has been a contentious issue contributing to the continuation of mass shootings. This critical oversight leaves a significant gap in preventing potentially dangerous individuals from acquiring deadly weapons. According to Malinowski, one of the primary reasons for the lack of adequate background and mental health checks is the complexity and variation of gun laws across different jurisdictions (Malinowski). Inconsistencies in regulations, including loopholes and limited enforcement, make it easier for individuals with a history of violence or mental illness to avoid restrictions imposed and obtain firearms without scrutiny. Furthermore, insufficient coordination and communication between various agencies involved in the background check process further exacerbates this problem. Existing databases may not be regularly updated or fail to capture relevant data, impeding the identification of potential red flags. Additionally, privacy concerns and legal barriers may limit the sharing of sensitive mental health information, preventing a comprehensive evaluation of whether an individual should be able to possess firearms. There is also a huge lack of funding and resources allocated to conducting thorough background checks and mental health assessments that contribute to the problem. Insufficient staffing and technology can result in backlogs and delays, allowing individuals to obtain firearms before their background checks are completed.

<h2 class="resolution"> The Extent Gun Control</h2>

<p class="third">
 According to Mainowski, the second amendment is one of the most controversial regulations within the United States constitution (Malinowski). Finding a happy medium between the restriction of gun rights/purchases without infringing upon citizen liberty is tricky. While the eradication of all guns for citizens is far too extreme, there is one specific firearm that is proven to be far too dangerous and needs immediate limitation. Semiautomatic firearms are responsible for approximately 70 percent of all mass shootings ever recorded. This is due to the fact semiautomatic firearms are capable of firing multiple rounds with each pull of the trigger, possess a higher rate of fire and ammunition capacity compared to other types of firearms. By implementing restrictions on these weapons, several key factors that contribute to the severity and scale of mass shootings can be addressed. Limiting access to semiautomatic firearms can reduce the lethality of mass shootings. The rapid rate of fire and high ammunition capacity of these weapons enable perpetrators to inflict extensive damage in a short amount of time. Furthermore, they are capable of firing multiple rounds without manually reloading allowing perpetrators to sustain a continuous barrage of gunfire, increasing the number of victims in a shorter span of time. By restricting their availability, the potential for a single individual to cause significant harm is diminished. This provides a critical window of opportunity for intervention, as it allows more time for law enforcement or others to respond and potentially prevent further casualties.

<h2 class="final"> Future Steps</h2>

<p class="done"> Mitigating the occurrence of mass shootings requires a multifaceted and comprehensive approach that will undoubtedly take time. However, in order for any beneficial alterations to occur and reduce the amount of mass shootings, steps need to be taken now. According to Malinowski, implementing stricter and more comprehensive background checks and mental health assessments is crucial (Malinowski).  Also, beginning a legislative push for increased restrictions on semiautomatic will help diminish the occurrence of these horrific events. </p>
